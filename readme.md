This is a derivative of the [simple d3.js graph in v4](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/402dd382a51a4f6eea487f9a35566de0) used as an example in the book [D3 Tips and Tricks v4](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4). The stock data was sourced from Mike Bostock's [small multiples example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1157787).

It is the first graph in a series that is building a multi-line graph that incorperates an automatically developed legend and a system that can toggle the lines off and on as desired.

This version is demonstrating the use of the `d3.nest` function to group the data to allow the different lines to be drawn.

The graph should be taken in context with the text of the [book](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4) which can be downloaded for free from Leanpub.
